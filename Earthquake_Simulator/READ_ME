RSQSim has been used to generate the earthquake catalogue. A catalogue using a different fault system and subduction zone configuration was generated by Bruce Shaw (2021) and can be found here:
Shaw, Bruce E. (2021). RSQSim Simulated Earthquake Catalog 5091, New Zealand, NSHM2012 Fault System, 276kyr (1.0) [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5534462. 
In this Zenodo respository there is also a link to the phython files that can be used to analyse the earthquake data, which can be found here as well (https://github.com/uc-eqgeo/rsqsim-python-tools).

The files used to generate the earthquake catalogue used in this research can be found here:

This Google drive contains a variety of files. 
The key files are discussed below, but additional files and figures are also included in the Google drive. 
Due to the size of the files, they are kept in the Google drive. A copy of the multiparam.in file is also included here.

Key Files:
Geometry File (ASCII): zfault_Deepen.in
ASCII file listing patch (triangular) geometry for the simulated faults in a UTM coordinate system (zone 11S). The primary columns are:
  * /x1, y1, z1/ - UTM coordinates of the first vertex
  * /x2, y2, z2/ - UTM coordinates of the second vertex
  * /x3, y3, z3/ - UTM coordinates of the third vertex
  * /rake/ - Direction of the motion of the hanging wall relative to the
    footwall (in degrees, following the convention of Aki & Richards, 2002)
  * /slip_rate/ - Long-term average slip rate (in m/s)

The first line in the file (excluding comment lines that start with '#') is the patch with ID=1, the second ID=2, etc. 
Additional metadata columns may exist in each line beyond those listed and can be ignored.

Catalog List Files (binary): .eList, .pList, .tList, .dList
The raw output of RSQSim includes 4 binary "list" files that define the simulated event IDs, times, and total slip in each participating patch. 
All 4 list files should be processed together, as the /N/-th item in onelist file corresponds to the /N/-th item in each other file.
For each patch the ruptures during an event, a value is written to each of these files giving 1) the patch number, 2) the event number, 3) the
distance slipped during the event, and 4) the time of first rupture for that patch during that event.
The format is as follows:
  * .eList: list of event IDs (1-based), stored as little-endian 4-byte integers
  * .pList: list of patch IDs (1-based), stored as little-endian 4-byte integers
  * .tList: list of time of first slip on each patch in each event (in seconds, relative to simulation origin time), stored as
    little-endian 8-byte double precision floating-point numbers
  * .dList: list of total slip on each patch in each event (in meters), stored as little-endian 8-byte double precision
    floating-point numbers

RSQSim Input File (ASCII): multiparam.in
Key-value pairs of RSQSim model parameters, used to originally run the simulation.
