RSQSim has been used to generate the earthquake catalogue. A catalogue using a different fault system and subduction zone configuration was generated by Bruce Shaw (2021) and can be found here:
Shaw, Bruce E. (2021). RSQSim Simulated Earthquake Catalog 5091, New Zealand, NSHM2012 Fault System, 276kyr (1.0) [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5534462. 
In this Zenodo respository there is also a link to the phython files that can be used to analyse the earthquake data, which can be found here as well (https://github.com/uc-eqgeo/rsqsim-python-tools).

The files used to generate the earthquake catalogue used in this research can be found here:
