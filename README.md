# TsunamiHazard_NZCFM
Tsunamis modelled using RSQSim earthquake catalogue generated from the 2022 New Zealand Community Fault Model (NZCFM)

The documents in this repository were used to undertake the tsunami hazard analysis presented in the paper: "A novel method to determine probabilistic tsunami hazard using a physics-based synthetic earthquake catalog: a New Zealand case study"
Included is:
1. The earthquake deformation file for the largest event in the catalogue.
2. The tsunami model files for the tsunami wave heights at the coast.
