# TsunamiHazard_NZCFM
Tsunamis modelled using RSQSim earthquake catalogue generated from the NZCFM

The documents in this repository were used to undertake the tsunami hazard analysis presented in the paper: "Using physics-based synthetic earthquake catalogs to determine probabilistic tsunami hazard: a new approach to assessing the near-field tsunami hazard posed to New Zealand."
Included is:
1. The earthquake deformation files.
2. The tsunami model files for each event.
3. The codes used to run the figures produced in this analysis.
